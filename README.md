# Coursera [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

This repository contains my solutions for the Specialization so far. As I progress on my studies I upload them here.

These are all coursera courses in Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization.
- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)
- [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)
- [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)
- [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings)
- [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity)
- [Genome Assembly Programming Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes)

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming language of your choice, Python3 on my case.

## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my:
