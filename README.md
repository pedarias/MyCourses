# PY4E
Some of my assignments for the Python For Everybody Specialization by University of Michigan, taught by Professor Charles Russell Severance.

It consists of 5 courses, namely:
1. Programming for Everybody
2. Python Data Structures
3. Using Python to Access Web Data
4. Using Databases with Python
5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/QW7JDZP2WCRV">Python for Everybody Specialization Certificate</a>

# IBM-DataScienceEcosystem
IBM/Coursera Peer-graded Assignment - Data Science Ecosystem

Assignment Topic:
I was provided with an empty Jupyterlite notebook which I launched in the course, to complete this assignment. I needed to include a combination of markdown and code cells. I did not needed to use the Markdown cheat sheet to help me determine the appropriate syntax for my markdown.
Guidelines for the submission:

There are a total of 25 points possible for this final project.
I hope I will succeed, based on the following Exercises:
Exercise 2 - Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook. (1 pt)
Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction. (1 pt)
Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. (3 pts)
Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries. (3 pts)
Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. (3 pts)
Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)
Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.(2 pts)
Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)
Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives. (3 pts)
Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Authorâ€™s name. (2 pts)
Exercise 12 - Share your notebook through GitHub (3 pts)
Exercise 13 - Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook. (1 pt)
