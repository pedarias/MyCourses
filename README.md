# PY4E
Some of my assignments for the Python For Everybody Specialization by University of Michigan, taught by Professor Charles Russell Severance.

It consists of 5 courses, namely:
1. Programming for Everybody
2. Python Data Structures
3. Using Python to Access Web Data
4. Using Databases with Python
5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/QW7JDZP2WCRV">Python for Everybody Specialization Certificate</a>

# IBM-DataScienceEcosystem
IBM/Coursera Peer-graded Assignment - Data Science Ecosystem

Assignment Topic:
I was provided with an empty Jupyterlite notebook which I launched in the course, to complete this assignment. I needed to include a combination of markdown and code cells. I did not needed to use the Markdown cheat sheet to help me determine the appropriate syntax for my markdown.
Guidelines for the submission:

There are a total of 25 points possible for this final project.
I hope I will succeed, based on the following Exercises:
Exercise 2 - Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook. (1 pt)
Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction. (1 pt)
Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. (3 pts)
Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries. (3 pts)
Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. (3 pts)
Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)
Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.(2 pts)
Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)
Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives. (3 pts)
Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Authorâ€™s name. (2 pts)
Exercise 12 - Share your notebook through GitHub (3 pts)
Exercise 13 - Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook. (1 pt)

# Coursera [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

This repository contains my solutions for the Specialization so far. As I progress on my studies I upload them here.

These are all coursera courses in Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization.
- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)
- [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)
- [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)
- [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings)
- [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity)
- [Genome Assembly Programming Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes)

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming language of your choice, Python3 on my case.

## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my:
